Hi guys !

I created a functional Weather web application with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Frameworks needed) .

only the basics of JavaScript and HTML, like JavaScript Objects, functions, If statements, ... etc are used.

The only difficulty I faced, is how to work with an API using JavaScript?but it's no longer a problem.

Let's talk little bit about the application; our weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (ex: 20Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (sunny sky), and then the user's city and country (Agadir, Morocco).

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
